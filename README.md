An Eclipse Java-based tool for producing ASCII art

Unfortunately this project was abandoned - better tools already exist for ASCII art creation, this was just specifically with the intention to animate the ASCII art in an Adobe Flash-like timeline. It is lacking comments.

The idea is that you draw a regular raster image on one canvas, and it is converted to colored ASCII on another canvas. It implements some editor features such as image layers and an animation timeline.
